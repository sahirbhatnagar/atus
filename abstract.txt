We consider a hierarchical model to characterize the effect of economy on the amount of time citizens spend
watching television.  Using penalized regression methods such as group LARS, we determine the strongest
sociodemographic predictors.  We account for the time dependent nature of the survey data through the use of 
autoregressive models. Measures of economic performance included include GDP, unemployment rate, and stock indices. PCA
is then used to determine an overall measure. Since there is a large number of respondents reporting no hours of 
television viewing a finite mixture model is used to account for the heterogeneity in the population.
