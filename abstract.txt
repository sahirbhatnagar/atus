We consider a statistical model to characterize the effect of economy on the amount of time citizens spend
watching television.  Using penalized regression methods such as group LARS, we determine the strongest
sociodemographic predictors among e.g. race, sex, education level.  We account for the time-dependent nature of the 
survey data through the use of a hierarchical model. Measures of economic performance include GDP, unemployment rate,
and stock indices, with PCA being used to derive an aggregate measure. A separate logistic model is proposed to account 
for the large number of respondents reporting no hours of television viewing.
