We consider the effect of economy on the amount of time citizens spend watching television, as reported by the 
American Time Use Survey (ATUS) between 2003 and 2012.  Using penalized regression methods such as group LARS, we determine 
the strongest sociodemographic predictors among e.g. race, sex, education level. We account for the time-dependent nature 
of the survey data through the use of a hierarchical model, which allows us to introduce economic variables in the model. 
Measures of economic performance include GDP, unemployment rate, and stock indices, as reported by federal agencies, with 
PCA being used to derive an aggregate measure. A separate logistic model is proposed to account for the large number of 
respondents reporting no hours of television viewing.
